# Issue 02 Image resizes when mouse hovers over

Whenever the mouse hovers over any image it changes the size slightly and restores when it leaves the area. That becomes annoying when mouse is moving across Obsidian UI. With no custom theme this doesn't happen. Can you please disable this behavior? Thanks

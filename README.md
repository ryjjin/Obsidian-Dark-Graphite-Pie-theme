# Obsidian-Dark-Graphite-Pie-theme

Theme for wonderful [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. I would be glad if someone will like and use it.

I’m not sure if I have the right to give this theme any unique name, since I don’t know CSS and glued this theme out of the three themes I like most:

- Obsidian dark rmx by _ph: https://github.com/cannibalox/Obsdn-dark-rmx/releases (used as a starter kit)
- Obsidian Red Graphite by Seanwcom: https://github.com/seanwcom/Red-Graphite-for-Obsidian (left panel styling and colors)
- Cybertron by Nick Milo: https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron (colors for graph in dark theme)
- Typora Pie by kevinzhao2233: https://github.com/kevinzhao2233/typora-theme-pie (look of quotes)

Initially, I wanted to adapt the Pie theme, which I often used in Typora, but in the end the themes listed above were so good that I could not choose any one.

Since version 0.9.2 I am already making independent changes without following the changes in the listed themes (but if someone else inspires me very much with their design, or friends ask me to add some specific design in terms of functions that I do not use  - for example, transparency of windows - I will indicate this in the changelog)
